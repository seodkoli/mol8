How to Unclog a Drain Without Calling a Plumber in HobartHave you ever found yourself in a situation where your sink or shower drain is clogged, but you would rather not call a plumber to fix it?  Well, don't worry!  <br><br>  One of the most common methods for unclogging drains is using a mixture of baking soda and vinegar.  Simply pour half a cup of baking soda down the drain, followed by half a cup of vinegar.  Allow the mixture to sit for about 30 minutes, then flush it down with hot water.  The chemical reaction between the baking soda and vinegar can help break up any blockages in the pipe.  Another method you can try is using a plunger.  <br><br>  This action can create enough pressure to dislodge whatever is causing the clog.  If neither of these methods work, you can also try using a plumbing snake or auger.  Insert the tool into the drain and twist it until you feel resistance.  Then slowly pull it out while twisting to catch onto any debris causing the clog.  Remember to always wear gloves when attempting to unclog a drain, as there may be bacteria or other unpleasant substances present.  <br><br></p></div>
