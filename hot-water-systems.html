<div> <p>In new construction projects, plumbers work closely with architects, engineers, and other tradespeople to design and implement plumbing systems that meet the specific needs of the building.  They must consider factors such as water pressure, drainage requirements, and accessibility when planning and executing their work.  One of the key responsibilities of plumbers in new construction projects is installing pipes that carry water to various parts of the building.  This involves measuring, cutting, and fitting pipes together to create a network that delivers clean water for drinking, cooking, bathing, and sanitation purposes.  Plumbers must also install fixtures such as sinks, toilets, showers, and appliances that connect to these pipes to ensure they function properly.  <br><br>  This includes setting up sewer lines that transport waste to municipal treatment facilities or septic tanks on-site.  Plumbers must ensure that these systems are installed correctly to prevent leaks or blockages that could lead to costly repairs down the line.  In addition to installation work, plumbers in new construction projects also perform inspections and tests to verify that plumbing systems meet building codes and regulations.  They may need to troubleshoot issues or make adjustments as needed to ensure everything is functioning correctly before the project is completed.  <br><br></p></div>
